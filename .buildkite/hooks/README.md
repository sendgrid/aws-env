# Buildkite Hooks
We have pre-populated your hooks directory with example hooks. For information on what you can do with hooks, please check out buildkite's documentation: https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/hooks

Once you have what you want in your hook, you will need to remove the .sample from the file name.
